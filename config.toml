[[params.introduction.paragraph]]
  text="""Photosynthetic microbes in the ocean are responsible for approximately half of all global carbon fixation. The way that these microbes interact with their changing environment shapes the globeâ€™s carbon cycles.
  
I am a masters student studying marine microbial proteomics under Dr. Erin Bertrand and Dr. Hugh MacIntyre. I am interested in how carbon and nutrient uptake shape primary productivity and carbon sequestration in the ocean.
