[[params.introduction.paragraph]]
  text="""Photosynthetic microbes in the ocean are responsible for approximately half of all global carbon fixation. The way that these microbes interact with their changing environment shapes the globeâ€™s biogeomechemical cycles, and therefore our climate.
  
I am a MSc researcher studying marine microbial proteomics under Dr. Erin Bertrand. I'm interested in how micronutrient limitation and changing temperature shape diatom physiology in the ocean. My current research uses high throughput proteomic and metabolomic techniques to answer these questions.
